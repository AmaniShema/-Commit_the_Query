# SQL Window Functions Project

## 👥 Team Project
This repository contains our work on SQL Window Functions, built using a regular sales dataset.

## 📘 Objectives
- Practice SQL Window Functions: `LAG()`, `LEAD()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, and aggregate `SUM() OVER`.
- Explain real-life applications of each.
- Collaborate as a team and track individual contributions.

## 🗃️ Dataset
A fictional `sales` table with `customer_id`, `sale_date`, and `sale_amount`.

## 📂 Structure
- `dataset/`: Sample dataset in SQL format.
- `queries/`: Window function SQL queries.
- `explanations/`: Explanations of queries and their real-world use cases.
- `screenshots/`: Output screenshots (if any).
